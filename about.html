				      <p>I am Sindhura and I am an aspiring <b>Data Analyst</b>.
				      	I'm a confident,energetic and motivated person and I love to work as a member or a leader of a team. I especially enjoy working with changing projects and taking them forward with rapid pace but high precision.

						After completing B.E in ECE,my job hunt has started. I started giving interviews at many offcampus placements. I always learn from my mistakes and from every failed interview,I learned something new. Just during that time, Tech Mahindra came to our college for placements and I got selected there.My journey with Tech Mahindra began from then(Oct 2013),Hyderabad location. I got trained on various subjects like automation tools,coding,spoken skills etc.

					<p>
						I interviewed with Google client that operated in <b> Media-Entertainment domain </b> and got selected for that project. I started working as a QA analyst where I tested their web applications as well as android mobile applciations.That was an exciting chance as I got to test on various (new) android devices(Samsung,Google,Sony,Tablets). It was a great experience with lots of learnings on my way. My Lead helped me understand how the world runs around data.This application was based on <b>data driven testing</b>.
						</p>
						<p>
						After 2years into this project, I got married and shifted to Pune.I got  selected for UPS client(within TechM) that operated in <b> Logistics and Supply Chain Management domain</b>. This project demanded <b>client interactions </b>on regular basis.I performed system testing in this project.That was the most interesting part for me,because until then I worked on UI/Front end. After 2years, this project got transitioned to Cognizant. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Later,I joined BT that operated in <b> Telecom domain </b>. This project was based on data driven testing. I performed continuous testing on backend application. I worked on <b> root cause analysis </b> to ensure the defects dont recur in future. After this project, I took a career break for my child in 2019. Me and my husband love cakes and pastries. During this break, I took baking lessons,baked cakes on regular basis. Many people complimented my cakes and I started Home Bakery on temporary basis as I dont like sitting idle at home.
					</p>
					<p>
						After my 2nd child was born, I gave a deep thought about career transition.My previous interest in coding and analysis created a spark to turn my interest into a career transition. My upskilling journey started from 2023 in <b>Data Science and Analytics area </b> through detailed offline and online trainings.
						I worked as an <b> Intern </b> at ETLHIVE for 2months and looking for better opportunities to restart my career.
						</p>
						<p>I am currently working on Data Analysis projects using SQL,Power BI, and Tableau to hone my skills. I am also doing a course on Gen AI and NLP projects from Udemy.
